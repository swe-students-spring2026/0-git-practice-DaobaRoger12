[What if writing tests was a joyful experience?](https://blog.janestreet.com/the-joy-of-expect-tests/)

## Why I Find This Article Interesting

The article discusses a testing approach called “expect tests,” which turns test writing into a more exploratory and interactive process. Instead of manually guessing expected outputs, developers allow the program to generate outputs and then “accept” them as expectations.

What I find most interesting is how tooling design directly affects developer behavior. By making tests easier and more pleasant to write, expect tests encourage more thorough testing and better documentation of program behavior. This article changed the way I think about testing: not just as a correctness check, but as a powerful tool for understanding and designing software systems.

## Comment By ZhiHui

I really like how you highlighted the connection between tooling design and developer behavior—that's such an important point that often gets overlooked. The idea that making something pleasant actually changes how thoroughly we do it applies beyond just testing too. Im curious if there are any downsides to this approach, like maybe becoming too reliant on auto-generated outputs without critically examining them first?
